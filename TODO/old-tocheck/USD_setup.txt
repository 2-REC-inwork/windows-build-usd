LOOK AT:
- How to build maya USD
  => Two great sources on how to build the Pixar and Animal Logic USD plugins for Maya.
  https://discourse.techart.online/t/how-to-build-usd/12227
  (outdated?)
  + CHECK THE COOKBOOK!

TO TEST:
Can find prebuilt binaries in Pypi package
(what about the dependencies?)
https://pypi.org/project/usd-core/



++++
(
merge/check with rest:
Download + install VS2019 Community edition (free, just need a MS account)
Components:
- Desktop dev c++  (TODO: add details!)
- Python dev (TODO: add details!)

Download Boost
https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_76_0.html
+Install (need to build? or headers are enough?)
https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/more/getting_started/windows.html
"To compile anything in Boost, you need a directory containing the boost\ subdirectory in your #include path. "

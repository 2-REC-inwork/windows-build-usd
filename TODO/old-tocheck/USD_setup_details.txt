# USD Windows Build

(TODO: add short description from Pixar site)
https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/index.html

This repositroy aims at helping build [USD](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD) from source in Windows.

The build process described here is based on the [USD Advanced Build Configuration](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/blob/release/BUILDING.md).

The process is aimed at version 21.08 of USD. Later versions might require changes, but the main process should remain the same.

Tested [versions for 3rd party libraries and applications](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/blob/release/VERSIONS.md) are listed.
However, even though USD is not part of the [VFX Reference Platform](https://vfxplatform.com/), the software and library versions used in the build process will try to follow the reference (when applicable).
CY2021 will be used as the annual reference.


Keep in mind that USD is not yet fully compatible with Windows, as indicated when executing the configure process:
```
CMake Warning at cmake/defaults/ProjectDefaults.cmake:34 (message):
  Building USD on Windows is currently experimental.
```
Some features of USD might not work as expected.

# Build Environment

## Tools

The software used for the build are the following:
* Windows 10 (64 bits)
* Visual Studio 2019 (MSVC142)
* NASM
* Python 3
  * PySide
  * PyOpenGL

Additional tools and libraries are required by the different modules as specified in the ["Dependencies"](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD#dependencies) section of the documentation.
The process and tools required to build each library is described in the following sections.


### Visual Studio

Using Visual Studio 2019 (Community Edition).

The follwoing components should be installed (from the VS Installer tool):
* Desktop development with C++
  (default packages)
  * MSVC v142
  * Windows 10 SDK v10 (latest)
  * C++ CMake tools for Windows
  * ... (TODO: others required?)
(TODO: needed? or standalone Python is enough?
* Python Development
  * Python 3.7.8 (64 bits)
)


### NASM

Required by the "Imaging" and "USD Imaging" modules.

NASM version 2.15.05 (64bits).

- Download from:
  https://www.nasm.us/
  Latest when writing this:
  https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.15.05/win64/
- Extract to:
  C:\ProgramData\nasm
- Define "NASMPATH" environment variable (must end with "\" character):
  NASMPATH=C:\ProgramData\nasm\

(? - needed?
* VSNASM
  => To use the build customisation in Visual Studio
  - Download from:
    https://github.com/ShiftMediaProject/VSNASM
    Master branch head:
    https://github.com/ShiftMediaProject/VSNASM/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
  - Extract to:
    C:\ProgramData\vsnasm
  - Add location in VS2019:
    "Tools" -> "Options..."
      "Project and Solutions" -> "VC++ Project Settings"
        "Build Customization Search Path"
(TODO: ?
usage: look at readme on github if needed)
)


### Python

Version 3.7.9 (64 bits).
...

Some libraries require Python 2.7.
More details are provided in the sections related to the libraries requiring it.


#### PySide

Required by the "USD View" module.

Version 5.15.2.

Install using PIP (run CMD as admin)
(TODO: specify version)
```
pip install PySide2
```
or
```
python.exe -m pip install PySide2
```

(TODO: remove (per info purpose, not important here)
- For offline install:
  - On computer with Internet connection:
    - Download using PIP:
      <python-path>\python.exe -m pip download -d <download-location> PySide2
    - Copy to shared location (or external device)
  - On computer without Internet connection:
    - Get access to shared location (or external device) where the downloaded files are located
    - Install using PIP (offline):
      (run CMD as admin)
      <python-path>\python.exe -m pip install PySide2 --no-index --find-links <download-location>
)

The location of the PySide binaries also needs to be added to the "PATH" environment variable (additionally to Python's install location):
```
set PATH=%PYTHON_PATH%;%PYTHON_PATH%\Scripts;%PATH%
```
If the location is not in "PATH", the build process will not find "pyside-uic.exe" and fail.


#### PyOpenGL

Aslo required by the "USD View" module.

Version 3.1.5.

Install using PIP (run CMD as admin)
(TODO: specify version)
```
pip install PyOpenGL
```
or
```
python.exe -m pip install PyOpenGL
```


## Environment

With the tools installed, additional steps are required to configure the environment for the build.
The changes to the Windows environment variable "PATH" might not be necessary depending on each individual setup.


(TODO: the paths can be different, should not hardcode...)
* Visual Studio Compiler environment
  - In a cmd, run "vcvars64.bat" from:
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build

* Python
  Add paths to Python installation and "Scripts" directory to "PATH":
  ```
  set PATH=%PYTHON_PATH%;%PYTHON_PATH%\Scripts;%PATH%
  ```
  Where "PYTHON_PATH" is the install location of Python.
  For example:
    %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37

* NASM
  Add path to NASM installation to "PATH":
  ```
  set PATH=%NASM_PATH%;%PATH%
  ```
  Where "NASM_PATH" is the install location of NASM.
  For example:
    C:\ProgramData\nasm

* PySide2 binaries
  Add paths to PySide2 binaries (essentially "pyside2-uic.exe") to "PATH":
  ```
  set PATH=%PYTHON_PATH%\Lib\site-packages;%PATH%
  ```
  Typically, PySide2 is installed in Python's "site-packages" directory.

(TODO: needed?
- PyOpenGL
  ...
)

(TODO: check correct - still valid?)
During the build process, if some dependencies are not found they will be automatically downloaded and built.
(TODO: check/list which ones)

However, some download links seem to be broken or out of date (especially some links from "SourceForge"), resulting in the process failure.
A solution is to manually download the dependencies.
- get files from "build_downloads"
- copy files to <INSTALL_PATH>/src

! - Had problems downloading files from SourceForge, needed other source.




## Required Components

### Boost

Requires "Boost.Python".

Boost 1.73.0.

(TODO: link to "boost" page)
=> Same as for Alembic and OIIO?


### Jinja2

(Python install with pip)

(TODO: more info...)


### TBB

Intel TBB 2020 Update 2.
****************************************************************************************************
(TODO: separate TBB page?)
****************************************************************************************************


(files reorganised as for OIIO)
Found, but warning:
(TODO: related to TBB or is it a cmake thing?)
```
-- Found TBB: C:/Users/2-REC/Documents/USD/deps/tbb/x64/Release/include (found version "2020.2") found components: tbb
CMake Deprecation Warning at cmake/defaults/Packages.cmake:204 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0072 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:23 (include)
```
(TODO: OK?)


### OpenSubdiv

Version 3.4.4.

(TODO: link to "opensubdiv" page)


## Optional Components

### OpenEXR

Required for OpenImageIO, OpenVDB or OSL support.

Version ... 3.4?

(TODO: link to "openexr" page)
=> Same as for Alembic? (and what about OIIO? OCIO?)


### OpenImageIO

(debug lib name might have "_d" suffix => fix)

(TODO: link to "oiio" page)


### OpenColorIO

(lib name might have version suffix => fix)

(TODO: link to "ocio" page)


### OSL (OpenShadingLanguage)

https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenShadingLanguage

****************************************************************************************************
(TODO: separate OSL page?)
TODO: EVERYTHING!!!!
****************************************************************************************************


### Alembic

Version 1.7.16.

(TODO: link to "alembic" page)


### Ptex

(TODO: link to OIIO/Ptex?)

If building with static libraries, the process will raise linking errors such as:
```
ptexTextureObject.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol
 "__declspec(dllimport) public: static class Ptex::v2_3::PtexCache * __cdecl Ptex::v2_3::PtexCache::create(int,unsigned __int64,bool,class Ptex::v2_3::PtexInputHandler *,class Ptex::v2_3::PtexErrorHandler *)"
 (__imp_?create@PtexCache@v2_3@Ptex@@SAPEAV123@H_K_NPEAVPtexInputHandler@23@PEAVPtexErrorHandler@23@@Z)
 referenced in function "protected: virtual void __cdecl pxrInternal_v0_21__pxrReserved__::HdStPtexTextureObject::_Load(void)" (?_Load@HdStPtexTextureObject@pxrInternal_v0_21__pxrReserved__@@MEAAXXZ)
 [...\build\pxr\imaging\hdSt\hdSt.vcxproj]
```
(TODO: find way to specify use of static libraries)

Using the shared libraries removes the error and allow the build process to continue.


### Metal

For MacOS builds, not relevant here.


### Vulkan

for 'hgiVulkan'?
(PXR_BUILD_GPU_SUPPORT or PXR_ENABLE_VULKAN_SUPPORT is OFF)


----

# Additional libraries

The build process will download and build the required libraries.
(TODO: or build manually? how to provide?)


## Zlib

(TODO: link to OIIO/zlib?)


----

# Tests

(TODO: see which tests should make)

-- Skipping validation of gf generated code because PXR_VALIDATE_GENERATED_CODE=OFF
-- Skipping validation of sdf generated code because PXR_VALIDATE_GENERATED_CODE=OFF
-- Skipping alembic-based usddiff tests because PXR_BUILD_ALEMBIC_PLUGIN=OFF
-- Skipping Draco-based usddiff tests because PXR_BUILD_DRACO_PLUGIN=OFF
-- Skipping usdedit tests, could not find sed command.

```

----

# RUN

SET PATHS! (for each dll: opensubdiv, tbb, boost, ptex?, zlib)
+ python (PyOpenGL, PySide2)
+ ADD runtime libs


## Runtime Errors

```
ERROR: Usdview encountered an error while rendering.No module named 'OpenGL'
```
=> Need PyOpenGL


-------------

!!!!
- Python Versions and DCC Plugins:
Some DCCs (most notably, Maya) may ship with and run using their own version of
Python. In that case, it is important that USD and the plugins for that DCC are
built using the DCC's version of Python and not the system version. This can be
done by running build_usd.py using the DCC's version of Python.
!!!!
=> Build DCC plugins on machine with DCC installed.
(eg: for Maya, can use 'mayapy')
